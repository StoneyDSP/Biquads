# Biquads
Multi-mode Biquad filter for audio analysis purposes

+ Under construction
+ Currently only 12dB Low Pass is implemented (using switchable transforms) - there is no parameter smoothing, so BE AWARE that modulating parameters in real-time WILL create loud clicks and pops while passing audio.

Please see my "Orfanidis Biquad" repository for further information meanwhile.
